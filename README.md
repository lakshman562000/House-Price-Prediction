# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning techniques. By analyzing multiple features such as crime rate, number of rooms, age of the property, and distance from various amenities, we build a model that can estimate the price of a house in a given area.
This project leverages XGBoost algorithm and Boston Housing Dataset to analyze key factors like location, size, crime rate, and air quality, providing reliable price estimates for potential homebuyers and investors.

# Project Overview
The project involves training a machine learning model to predict house prices based on historical data. We use regression algorithms like XGBoost to fit a model to the data, and the model is capable of predicting the price for new input data.


# Dataset

- House_Price.csv Dataset
- 507 rows and 19 columns
- The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
price: House price.
crime_rate: Crime Rate (scale of 1-10).
resid_area: Residential Area (sqft).
air_qual: Air quality index.
room_num: Number of rooms in the house.
age: Age of the property (in years).
dist1: Distance to city center(km).
dist2: Distance to Public Transport (km).
dist3: Distance to School (km).
dist4: Distance to Hospital (km).
teachers: Number of teachers in nearby Schools.
poor_prop: Proportion of poor Families in the Area (%).
airport: Distance to the nearest airport (in kilometers).
n_hos_beds: Number of Hospital Beds in nearby Hospital.
n_hot_rooms: Number of Hotel Rooms in Area.
waterbody: Proximity to a waterbody (scale of 1-5).
rainfall: Proximity to Waterbody (1-5 scale).
bus_ter: Distance to the nearest bus terminal (km).
parks: Number of parks in the area.
